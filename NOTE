->  IN JAVA THERE IS NO OPERATOR OVERLOADING , ONLY ONE INTENTIONAL OPERATOR OVERLOADING GIVEN BY JAVA IS 
    "+" OPERATOR AS WE CAN USE IT FOR STRING CONCATINATION AND ADDITION OF INTEGERS
->  no of digits in base 'b' of number 'n' = int(log n base b ) + 1

->  if n&(n-1)==0 then n is power of 2

->  gcd (a,b) = gcd(reminder(b,a),a); euclid's algorithmm 

->  final varibale must be always initialized when it is declared

->  staic varibale are not depended on object . even if the object are not created it can be accesed.(how)

->  static block runs only once when a first object is created.

->  static methods cant be overriden
